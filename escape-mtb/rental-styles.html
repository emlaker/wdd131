            <p class="rental-msg">When it comes to mountain biking there are several different styles, and each one serves a unique purpose. Just like tools you need the right one for the job! Here we have a nice mix of full suspension and hard-tail bikes, disk brakes and v-brakes, and regular or grip-shift. I know that there is a lot to take in, especially if you are new, so that is why we offer the ability to chat with an employee to explain what each feature bring to the table! Below you will find a series of pictures of mountain bikes with each of these features, along with their prices. We want to make sure that you pick the right one for you, so please make sure to contact us. We love to help and want to make sure you have an amazing experience outdoors, which is why we also offer guided tours of different trails in the area for those of you who are new to the area or Mountain Biking in general. Below are different ways to reach out to us, and we are looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
