			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This site is all about connecting mountain biking fans. Whether you are sharing trail tips, your favorite places to ride, or just looking for cool people to ride with, we have a community page for you. Plus, there is a rental shop to hook you up with the gear you need to hit the trails. It is a one-stop spot for all things MTB!</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>My audience will be mountain bike enthusists and those passionate about the outdoors.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>I will make a cool slideshow-style element that will cycle through photos automatically and if you click on the arrows you can cycle them manually as well. I will also make a submit form on the community page that will allow people to make comments on the page and ask questions. Maybe a pretend Credit Card like in the previous assignment with the ability to submit info.</p>

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a href="https://coolors.co/ffffff-2a628f-13293d-3e92cc" target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ffffff-2a628f-13293d-3e92cc</a>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>

					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>[Hero image of a mountain bike overlooking a beautiful view. Paragraphs explaining what the sit is about, and what each page entails briefly.]</p>
			<h3>Community Page</h3>
			<p>[This will have images of groups of people mountain biking together in a grid, with some descriptions of what the page is. There will also be a box where people can submit what they want on the page.]</p>
			<h3>Rental Page</h3>
			<p>[This will have images of groups of different mountain bike styles and parts in a slideshow format. There will also be additional images of parts and styles below with descriptions of what they are. There might also be the option for a credit card form and the ability to submit the information. If I did go that route I would probably have a cart that people could add stuff to before the enter the card stuff.]</p>
			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[The hero image is the big image above. Then there is the description of other pages, then below is the footer which will be consistent across all pages.]
			</p>
			<img src="images/home-wireframe.png" alt="home page wireframe"/>

			<h3>Community Page</h3>
			<p>
				[The text box will have a brief description about the page, and will also have an explanation of what the site should be used for. The two submit boxes will be for a username and the comment they want to submit to the page. What they type will be displayed below, which is what the list style icons are for.]
			</p>
			
			<img src="images/community-wireframe.png" alt="Community Page Wireframe"/>
			
			<h3>Rental Page</h3>
